# Fault Trace

Fault Trace is a 12-month-long project exploring data sonification and visualisation.

Each month a new song will be released based on earthquake data for that month. Each song will be unique in style, time signature, tempo, and time acceleration.

Fault Trace is an open source project built with Processing, Python, and Ableton Live.

This song was inspired by artists such as Brian Eno, Rae Howell, and Fabrizio Patterlini.
