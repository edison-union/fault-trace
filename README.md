# Fault Trace

Fault Trace is an experiment in data sonification, visualisation, and the creative process of song writing.

Each month a new song will be released based on earthquake data for that month. Each song will be unique in style, time signature, tempo, and time compression.

Fault Trace is an open source project built with Processing, Python, and Ableton Live.

This month's song was created by Melbourne-based artist Jay Curtis/lysdexic. Thank you to Jay for all your hard work and awesome track, it was a great collaboration.
